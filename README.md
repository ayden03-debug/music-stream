## 🔍 Viewing the Code

- All UI logic lives under **`src/`**, broken into reusable components.
- Check out how the pink gradient theme and custom icons are implemented in **`assets/`** and **`components/`**.
- No backend—everything is mocked/stubbed for layout purposes.

> Feel free to browse the code and see how the layout, theming, and component structure come together!
